Testplan:

We tested with a name/number struct called nametag, that takes a string and an int.
It sorts first by reverse alphabetical order, then by descending order of the integer part of the name struct.
We also tested with doubles, strings, and integers, all sorted in descending order.

Integer Test:
Inserted numbers (order of insert preserved): 1 29 4 3 5 0
Expected output: 29 5 4 3 1 0

Double Test:
Inserted numbers (order of insert preserved): 11.1 29.7 77.6 8.1 3.25 .12	
Expected output: 77.7 29.7 11.1 8.1 3.25 .12

String Test:
Inserted values (order of insert preserved): "ab" "cd" "ef" "zz" "yz" "qqq" "help"
Output: "help" "qqq" "yz" "zz" "ef" "cd" "ab"

NameTag Test:
Inputs: "Pat Barrett 1" "Michael 19" "Michael 94"
Outputs: "Pat Barrett 1" "Michael 94" "Michael 19"

Remove after iterator is made:
Original List Inputs: 1 29 4 3 5 0
Object Removed: 3
Output: 29 5 4 1 0
